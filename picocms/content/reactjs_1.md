# The modern Frontend

I started out my career path as a software developer working with PHP and Javascript. And while I hated PHP, I was absolutely terrified of Javascript. The stuff hardly ever worked as I wanted it to. I had to work around the idiosyncrasies and quirks of the language. And while most of it can be written off as my obvious inexperience and lack of programming skills at that time, the deep seated irrational fear of Javascipt and all its forms, frameworks and libraries remained. I generally avoided the language where I could, be it on the Frontend or the Backend.

Up until now.

The modern Frontend landscape has come miles in terms of frameworks and now it is exceedingly simple to abstract out the lower level components of the DOM, leave out that kind of heavy lifting to the many libraries and frameworks and concentrate only on the core functionality of the frontend.

Or so I have heard.

I would not know for sure until I go in deep and get my hands dirty. So, I start this series with the agenda to break out ReactJS, attempt to develop a functional app and found out exactly what has changed on the Frontend scene in these past years.

## Why ReactJS

Its popular for one. Substantially so, as per [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?cat=31&q=Vue.js,React,Angular). Google's own Angular (previously known as AngularJS) used to hold the top spot for a long time until being dethroned by the new ruler of the Frontend: long enough to catch my eye.

I began exploring Angular(JS at that time) but soon found it either boring or not developer friendly enough. Or may be, not enough people were doing it then, for me to get the required support. And ReactJS is supposed to be easier to work with.

Two reasons are good enough to start with, yes?

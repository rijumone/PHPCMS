# Intro

Ah, the trails of stars while the earth rotates beneath them.

What if I told you, this was shot on a smartphone camera?

## The equipment

First, you need to ensure that your smartphone's camera app has a "pro" (or "manual") mode.

For example, my [OnePlus 5T](https://www.oneplus.in/support/spec/oneplus-5t) has it inside the slide out drawer.

Once you are sure of your phone's manual mode prowess, next, you need a tripod. Something like [this](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B00XI87KV8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) is servicing me currently and works well. You might also need a [phone mount](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B07S9KNGVS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for the tripod.

Now, that we have the equipment in place, let's learn about the settings we need to make on the camera app.
